# Processes and Life cycles

Processes are ordered sets of activities, Each activity in the process has a goal, 
as well as entry/exit criteria and input/output. Processes may contain sub-processes.

## Waterfall model

A very common approach to building software. It consists of phases, such as requirements,
system design, module design, ... , system testing, acceptance testing, maintenance. These
phases are executed sequentially, transitions to the next phase only occur when that phase
is fully completed.

## Iterative development

Consists of developing a system through repeated cycles allowing developers to take
advantage of what was learned during the previous development phases. The functionality
is prioritized - the most important parts are done first. Each iteration has a fixed time
period.

### Rational unified process (RUP)

An iterative software development process framework recognized to be
particularly applicable to large projects with large teams.

### Agile approaches

Lightweight approaches to satisfy the customers with "early and continuous delivery of
valuable software".

#### Manifesto for Agile Software Development

- Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
- Working software over comprehensive documentation
- Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
- Responding to change over following a plan
