## Software requirement
Intuitively: a property of behaviour we want from a system

### Examples
- Web shop: When user enters type of T-shirt, the system shall show a palette of colors
- Car simulator: The feel of the brakes must be realistic

### Writing a natural language requirement

- Always use a complete sentence to avoid confusion

- A sentence expresses a complete thought and consists of a subject and a predicate.

- Use modal verbs: "shall", "will", "must"

- Don't use words like "should", "would", "might"

- Be careful with quantifiers like "all", "never"

### Functional requirements

- Describe the behaviour or features of a software

Think of a the mathematical definition of a function: 

    save on exit (yes, no) -> result
                f(x) -> y

### Non functional requirements

- Design constaints, limiting the solution space

Example "The system shall be implemented in php"

- Quality requirements

### Other domains for non functional requirements

- Scalability
- Reliability
- Security
- Environmental
- Maintainability
- Usability
- ...
