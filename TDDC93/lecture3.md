## Software requirement
Intuitively: a property of behaviour we want from a system

### Examples
- Web shop: When user enters type of T-shirt, the system shall show a palette of colors
- Car simulator: The feel of the brakes must be realistic

### Writing a natural language requirement

- Always use a complete sentence to avoid confusion

- A sentence expresses a complete thought and consists of a subject and a predicate.

- Use modal verbs: "shall", "will", "must"

- Don't use words like "should", "would", "might"

- Be careful with quantifiers like "all", "never"

### Functional requirements

- Describe the behaviour or features of a software

Think of a the mathematical definition of a function: 

    save on exit (yes, no) -> result
                f(x) -> y

### Non functional requirements

- Design constaints, limiting the solution space

Example "The system shall be implemented in php"

- Quality requirements

Example "Minimum response time should be 2.0 seconds."

### Other domains for non functional requirements

- Scalability
- Reliability
- Security
- Environmental
- Maintainability
- Usability
- ...

### User interface requirements

An integral part of most applications now and often a major selling point for the 
customer.
- easy to operate
- quick in response
- ...

### Features

A distinguising characteristic of a system item.

Higher level stuff, used in advertising.

"The system shall have an SMS delivery notification service"

### Software Requirements Specification (SRS)

Requirements in a good SRS are:
- Numbered
- Inspected
- Prioritised
- Unambiguous
- Testable
- Complete
- Consistent
- Traceable
- Feasible
- Modifiable
- Useful for operation, maintenance, customer, developer...

### Use-case modeling
A use case is a particular form or pattern or exemplar of usage, a scenario that
begins with some user of the system initiating some transaction of sequence of 
interrelated events.

- Pretty much just a description of an example usage of the system.
- Often expressed in UML-notation
