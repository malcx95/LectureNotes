## Project definition

A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product or service

There is a balance between goal and process:

- Clear purpose or goal, but no predefined process to follow 

- Unclear purpose or goal, but a clear process to follow

## Project parameters

Four dependent project parameters are:

- Calendar time

- Resources

- Features

- Quality

## Milestones and toll-gates

A milestone is a mean to verfify sub goal fulfillment. Is a property of a SMART-goal.

A tollgate is an external decision point.

## Effort estimation

### The Delphi technique

First, experts make individual predictions secretly from others. The predictions are then
anonymously shown to the experts. The experts discuss the estimates. If their predictions
converge, they are done. If not, go back to the beginning.

## Risk

__Risk management__: The process of measuring or assessing risk and then delevoping 
stragegies to manage the risk.

### 1. Risk identification

Brainstorming of things that can go wrong.

- Technology risks - hardware or software technology used for the development

- People risks - people in the team

- Organizational risks

- Tools risks - risk with the currently used tools

- Requirements risks - changes in customer requirements

- Estimation risks - wrong project estimations

### 2. Risk analysis

Assess the risks based on __probablility__ and __impact__.

#### Probability

- 1: low

- 2: moderate

- 3: high

- 4: very high

#### Impact

- 1: insignificant

- 2: tolerable

- 3: serious

- 4: catastrophic

#### Risk magnitude indicator

Once each risk has been given a probability and impact rating, multiply them
to get the _Risk Magnitude Indicator_. Sort the list of risks after this value.

### 3. Risk planning

Plan the course of action taken regarding the risks.

- 1: Risk avoidance - reorganize so that the risk disappears

- 2: Risk transfer - reorganize so that someone else takes the risk, insurance, customer, bank

- 3: Risk acceptance - either lower the probability by mitigating the risk or
define a contingency plan to lower the impact.
