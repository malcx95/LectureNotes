# Image classification with CNN:s

## Initialization

- Initialization in area connected to a solution results in faster learning
- Initial weights may not be symmetrical or identical, would lead to redundancy
- Initial weight should be large to break symmetry, 
    but not too large to avoid numerical issues.
