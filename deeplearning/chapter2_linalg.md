# 2.7 Eigendecomposition
- A matrix is positive definite if all eigenvalues are strictly > 0. Semidefinite if greater or equal to 0.

# 2.8 SVD

The left-singular vectors of A are the eigenvectors of AA^T, and the right-singular vectors are the eigenvalues
of A^TA. The non-zero singular values of A are the square roots of the eigenvalues of AA^T and A^TA.

# 2.9 The Moore-Penrose Pseudoinverse

The pseudo-inverse of a matrix with more columns than rows provides the solution with minimal euclidian nrom along
all possible solutions.
